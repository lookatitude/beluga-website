```go
import "github.com/lookatitude/beluga-ai/resilience"
```

Package resilience provides fault-tolerance primitives for the Beluga AI
framework: retry with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, hedged requests,
and provider-aware rate limiting.

## Retry

The generic Retry function executes a function up to a configured number of
attempts with exponential backoff and optional jitter. It respects context
cancellation and uses core.IsRetryable to determine which errors are
retryable.

```go
result, err := resilience.Retry(ctx, resilience.DefaultRetryPolicy(), func(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
    return callExternalAPI(ctx)
})
```

RetryPolicy controls maximum attempts, initial backoff, maximum backoff,
backoff multiplier, jitter, and optionally restricts retries to specific
error codes.

## Circuit Breaker

CircuitBreaker implements the circuit-breaker stability pattern. It wraps
function calls and short-circuits when a failure threshold is exceeded,
giving the downstream dependency time to recover.

State transitions:

- closed → open: after failureThreshold consecutive failures
- open → half-open: after resetTimeout elapses
- half-open → closed: on a successful probe call
- half-open → open: on a failed probe call

Usage:

```go
cb := resilience.NewCircuitBreaker(5, 30*time.Second)
result, err := cb.Execute(ctx, func(ctx context.Context) (any, error) {
    return callService(ctx)
})
if errors.Is(err, resilience.ErrCircuitOpen) {
    // circuit is open, handle gracefully
}
```

## Hedged Requests

Hedge executes a primary function immediately. If it does not return within
a delay, a secondary function is started concurrently. The result from
whichever completes successfully first is returned. Both goroutines are
cancelled once a result is available.

```go
result, err := resilience.Hedge(ctx, primaryFn, fallbackFn, 100*time.Millisecond)
```

## Rate Limiting

RateLimiter enforces provider-specific rate limits using token-bucket
algorithms for RPM (requests per minute) and TPM (tokens per minute),
plus a semaphore for concurrency control. Configure limits via
ProviderLimits:

```go
rl := resilience.NewRateLimiter(resilience.ProviderLimits{
    RPM:           60,
    TPM:           100000,
    MaxConcurrent: 10,
})
if err := rl.Allow(ctx); err != nil {
    // rate limited or context cancelled
}
defer rl.Release()
```
