```go
import "github.com/lookatitude/beluga-ai/schema"
```

Package schema defines the shared types used throughout the Beluga AI framework.

It contains message types for conversations, multimodal content parts,
tool call and result types, document types for RAG, streaming event types,
and session types. This package has zero external dependencies beyond the
standard library and contains no business logic — only type definitions
and constructors.

## Messages

The `Message` interface represents a single message in a conversation.
Concrete implementations cover all conversation roles:

- [SystemMessage] — system-level instructions that set model behavior
- [HumanMessage] — messages from human users
- [AIMessage] — model-generated responses with optional tool calls and usage stats
- [ToolMessage] — results from tool executions, correlated by tool call ID

Convenience constructors create messages with a single text part:

```go
sys := schema.NewSystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant.")
msg := schema.NewHumanMessage("What is the weather today?")
ai  := schema.NewAIMessage("The weather is sunny.")
tool := schema.NewToolMessage(callID, `{"temp": 72}`)
```

## Content Parts

Messages carry multimodal content via the `ContentPart` interface.
Implementations support text, images, audio, video, and files:

- [TextPart] — plain text content
- [ImagePart] — image data (inline bytes or URL) with MIME type
- [AudioPart] — audio data with format and sample rate
- [VideoPart] — video data (inline bytes or URL) with MIME type
- [FilePart] — generic file attachments with name and MIME type

## Tool Types

`ToolCall` represents a model's request to invoke a tool, carrying the
tool name and JSON-encoded arguments. `ToolResult` carries the tool's
output back to the model. `ToolDefinition` describes a tool's interface
with name, description, and JSON Schema for the model to use.

## Documents

`Document` is the primary unit for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
pipelines, carrying text content, metadata for filtering, optional
relevance scores from retrieval, and optional embedding vectors.

## Streaming Events

`StreamChunk` represents incremental pieces of a streaming model response
with text deltas, tool call updates, finish reasons, and token usage.
`AgentEvent` represents discrete events emitted during agent execution
such as thoughts, tool calls, and handoffs.

## Sessions

`Session` tracks a full conversation as an ordered sequence of `Turn`
values, each containing an input message, output message, timestamp,
and metadata. Sessions maintain arbitrary state across turns.

## Token Usage

`Usage` tracks token consumption for model responses, including input
tokens, output tokens, total tokens, and cached tokens.
