```go
import "github.com/lookatitude/beluga-ai/voice"
```

Package voice provides the voice and multimodal pipeline for the Beluga AI
framework. It implements a frame-based processing model inspired by Pipecat
where atomic Frames (audio chunks, text fragments, images, control signals)
flow through linked FrameProcessors via Go channels.

## Frame Types

The fundamental data unit is the `Frame`, which carries typed data:

- [FrameAudio] — raw audio data (PCM, Opus, etc.)
- [FrameText] — text fragments (transcripts, LLM output)
- [FrameControl] — control signals (start, stop, interrupt, end-of-utterance)
- [FrameImage] — image/video frames for multimodal pipelines

Convenience constructors are provided: `NewAudioFrame`, `NewTextFrame`,
`NewControlFrame`, and `NewImageFrame`.

## FrameProcessor Interface

The core abstraction is the `FrameProcessor` interface. Each processor reads
frames from an input channel, processes them, and writes results to an output
channel. Processors run as goroutines and must close the output channel when
done.

```go
type FrameProcessor interface {
    Process(ctx context.Context, in <-chan Frame, out chan<- Frame) error
}
```

Use `FrameProcessorFunc` to adapt plain functions as FrameProcessors. Use
`Chain` to connect multiple processors in series.

## Pipeline Modes

Three composable pipeline modes are supported:

- Cascading: STT → LLM → TTS (each a FrameProcessor goroutine)
- S2S: Native audio-in/audio-out (OpenAI Realtime, Gemini Live)
- Hybrid: S2S default, fallback to cascade for complex tool use

## Cascading Pipeline

The `VoicePipeline` implements the cascading mode:

```go
pipe := voice.NewPipeline(
    voice.WithTransport(transport),
    voice.WithVAD(vad),
    voice.WithSTT(stt),
    voice.WithLLM(model),
    voice.WithTTS(tts),
)
err := pipe.Run(ctx)
```

## Hybrid Pipeline

The `HybridPipeline` combines S2S and cascade modes, switching based on a
configurable `SwitchPolicy`:

```go
hybrid := voice.NewHybridPipeline(
    voice.WithS2S(s2sEngine),
    voice.WithCascade(cascadePipeline),
    voice.WithSwitchPolicy(voice.OnToolOverload),
)
err := hybrid.Run(ctx)
```

## Voice Activity Detection

The `VAD` interface detects speech in audio data. A built-in `EnergyVAD`
uses RMS energy thresholds, and providers in voice/vad/providers/ offer
Silero and WebRTC-based detection. The VAD registry follows the standard
`RegisterVAD`/`NewVAD`/`ListVAD` pattern.

## Session Management

The `VoiceSession` tracks conversational state (idle, listening, speaking)
and `Turn` history. It is safe for concurrent use.

## Hooks

The `Hooks` struct provides optional callbacks for pipeline events:
OnSpeechStart, OnSpeechEnd, OnTranscript, OnResponse, and OnError.
Use `ComposeHooks` to merge multiple hooks.

## Latency Budget

Target end-to-end latency: transport <50ms, VAD <1ms, STT <200ms,
LLM TTFT <300ms, TTS TTFB <200ms, return <50ms = <800ms E2E.
