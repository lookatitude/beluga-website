```go

```

Package auth provides capability-based authorization for the Beluga AI
framework. It implements RBAC, ABAC, and composite policy patterns with a
default-deny security model. Every authorization check is explicit — if no
policy grants access, the request is denied.

## Policy Interface

The core Policy interface requires two methods:

- Name returns a unique identifier for the policy.
- Authorize checks whether a subject is allowed to perform a permission
  on a resource. Returns (false, nil) for a clean deny.

## RBAC

RBACPolicy implements role-based access control. Subjects are assigned one
or more roles via AssignRole, and authorization checks whether any assigned
role contains the requested permission.

```go
rbac := auth.NewRBACPolicy("main")
rbac.AddRole(auth.Role{Name: "admin", Permissions: []auth.Permission{auth.PermToolExec}})
rbac.AssignRole("alice", "admin")
allowed, err := rbac.Authorize(ctx, "alice", auth.PermToolExec, "calculator")
```

## ABAC

ABACPolicy implements attribute-based access control. Rules with conditions
and priorities are evaluated in priority order (highest first); the first
matching rule determines the outcome.

```go
abac := auth.NewABACPolicy("env-check")
abac.AddRule(auth.Rule{
    Name:       "prod-deny-write",
    Effect:     auth.EffectDeny,
    Priority:   100,
    Conditions: []auth.Condition{isProdEnv},
})
```

## Composite Policies

CompositePolicy combines multiple policies using configurable modes:

- AllowIfAny allows access if any child policy allows (logical OR).
- AllowIfAll allows access only if all child policies allow (logical AND).
- DenyIfAny denies access if any child policy denies (conservative).

## Built-in Permissions

Standard permissions include PermToolExec, PermMemoryRead, PermMemoryWrite,
PermAgentDelegate, and PermExternalAPI. Custom Permission values can be
defined as needed.

## Middleware and Hooks

The package supports the standard Beluga middleware and hooks patterns:

- WithHooks wraps a Policy with lifecycle callbacks for OnAuthorize,
  OnAllow, OnDeny, and OnError events.
- WithAudit wraps a Policy with slog-based audit logging.
- ApplyMiddleware composes middlewares in the standard right-to-left order.

## Registry

Policy factories register via the standard Beluga registry pattern with
Register, New, and List.
